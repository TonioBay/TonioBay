## Hi there
I'm Chemichal Engineer who got into Data Science almost by accident and after that make the decision to learn much more stuff programming related.

### Currently Learning
- ML models
- Neural Networks
- Rust
- Trying to do not start new projects until I end the ones I'm working at

Actually, my gf was the one who got me into programming to be honest.
